          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <h3><b>Describe</b></h3>
            <p>Throughout the internship, I actively participated in various tasks.  My primary responsibility was developing computer exercises using R and Python.  I strived to incorporate real-world datasets relevant to workshop topics, ensuring participants could apply their learnings to practical scenarios.  For each exercise, I meticulously crafted corresponding solutions with detailed explanations for participants.  This involved not only providing the correct answer but also breaking down the thought process and reasoning behind each step.  I aimed to create a learning experience that fostered not just problem-solving skills but also a deeper understanding of the underlying data science concepts.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <h3><b>Interpret</b></h3>
            <p>While I believe I consistently delivered high-quality work, some aspects of my approach could have been further optimized.  One area for improvement lies in my communication with the InsightRSA team.  Initially, I focused on independently completing assigned tasks.  While this ensured efficiency, it limited opportunities to gain deeper insights into the team's thought processes and decision-making.  For instance, during the exercise creation process, I could have benefited from  earlier discussions about the specific learning objectives for each workshop.  Understanding the desired learning outcomes would have allowed me to tailor the exercises more effectively.</p>

            <h3><b>Evaluate</b></h3>
            <p>Limited communication led to a missed opportunity for collaborative learning.  By actively engaging with the team and seeking their input, I could have gained valuable  perspectives on the educational design process.  Furthermore, early discussions could have identified potential challenges or gaps in the exercises, allowing for proactive solutions.  For example, the team might have had specific accessibility considerations or preferred pedagogical approaches that I would have been unaware of without open communication.  Additionally, collaborative brainstorming could have yielded more creative and engaging exercise formats.</p>

            <h3><b>Plan</b></h3>
            <p>Moving forward, I plan to prioritize proactive communication in future collaborative projects.  This includes  initiating discussions to understand project goals, seeking feedback throughout the process, and actively seeking opportunities to learn from more experienced team members.  Furthermore, I will explore strategies for effective communication in a virtual setting, as remote work becomes increasingly common.  Resources such as online collaboration tools like shared documents and project management platforms can foster a transparent and efficient workflow.  Additionally, establishing clear communication protocols and regular check-ins can ensure everyone is on the same page and keeps projects moving forward smoothly.

          <h2>Ethical Conduct</h2>
        </div>  
        <div class=" row artefacts">
          <p>During my placement at Insight Research Services Associated (InsightRSA), I encountered several situations that highlighted the importance of ethical conduct and professional accountability in the ICT industry. One particular experience stands out, involving the handling of sensitive data for workshop exercises. As part of my responsibilities, I was tasked with preparing computer exercises using real-world datasets. These datasets contained personal and sensitive information, which required careful handling to protect privacy and comply with ethical standards. The experience underscored the critical need for professionalism and ethical conduct in data science.</p>

          <h3><b>Handling Sensitive Data</b></h3>
          <ul>
            To ensure the proper use of personal information, I implemented several key measures:
            <li><b>Anonymization:</b> Before using any dataset for exercises, I anonymized the data to remove personally identifiable information (PII). This step was crucial in preventing any misuse of personal data.</li>
            <li><b>Access Control:</b> I restricted access to the raw datasets, ensuring that only authorized personnel could view or manipulate the sensitive information. This minimized the risk of unauthorized data disclosure.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><b>Respect and Professionalism</b></h3>
          Throughout the placement, I maintained a high level of respect for colleagues, clients, and other stakeholders by:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Clear Communication:</b> I ensured clear and respectful communication, especially when discussing sensitive data or ethical considerations.</li>
            <li><b>Feedback and Collaboration:</b> I actively sought feedback from peers and mentors, fostering a collaborative environment and promoting a culture of responsibility and ethical conduct.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><b>Reflection and Improvement</b></h3>
          While I believe I handled the situation responsibly, there are areas for improvement:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Enhanced Training:</b> More comprehensive training on data ethics and privacy would further strengthen my ability to handle sensitive information responsibly.</li>
            <li><b>Proactive Ethical Audits:</b> Implementing regular ethical audits of my work could help identify and address potential issues before they escalate.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><em>Reflection on Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation</em></h3>
          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>In April 2024, I completed a job simulation with Accenture North America, focusing on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst. This experience involved cleaning, modeling, and analyzing seven datasets to uncover content trends and inform strategic decisions.</p>

          <h4>Action</h4>
          <ul>I approached the task systematically:
            <li><b>Data Cleaning:</b> Ensured data integrity and consistency by handling missing values and outliers.</li>
            <li><b>Data Modeling:</b> Developed models to analyze content trends and user engagement metrics.</li>
            <li><b>Analysis and Insights:</b> Identified key trends and patterns, providing actionable insights for the client.</li>
            <li><b>Presentation:</b> Prepared a PowerPoint deck and a video presentation to effectively communicate the findings to the client and internal stakeholders.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Results</h4>
          <ul>The project honed several crucial skills:

            <li><b>Data Analysis and Modeling:</b> Strengthened my ability to clean, model, and analyze complex datasets.</li>
            <li><b>Communication:</b> Improved my ability to convey technical insights in an understandable manner through presentations.</li>
            <li><b>Strategic Thinking:</b> Enhanced my ability to derive strategic insights from data, informing decision-making processes.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Learning</h4>
          <p>The simulation provided valuable real-world experience in data analysis and visualization, aligning closely with industry practices. It reinforced the importance of clear communication and strategic thinking in data-driven roles. Moreover, the experience highlighted the necessity of meticulous data handling and the impact of well-presented insights on business decisions.</p>
